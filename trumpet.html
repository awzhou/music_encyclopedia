      <img src="trumpet.jpg">
			<p class="gochi">The trumpet is a member of the brass family which includes trumpets, trombones, horns, tubas, and euphoniums. A soprano brass instrument commonly about 4 1/2 feet in tube length, folded twice to a narrow rectangular shape about 14 inches long.  It is the highest voice in the brass section and can often be heard carrying fanfare-like melodies. The trumpet produces a very brass-like tone which carries very easily through the orchestra. The trumpet is made out of metal and changes pitch using three valves as well as changing of the player's embouchure. Like the clarinet, trumpets are in B-flat (see clarinet article for how that works). In the orchestra, trumpets sit in the back row in front of the percussion, either on stage left, center, or stage right.</p>
